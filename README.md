 Portfolio from Aitor Bernab√© with the code for a 3D Platformer game.

My first idea was to create an starter level for a 3D platformer with some interactions, but time wasn't on my side so I've been trying to make every
little detail as good as I could. I'll keep updating this project as practice and a way to learn.

I made everything from scratch, without any add on, to make sure I was understanding each part of the process.

I had some problems learning how Unity handles some interactions between systems, but I think I have learned a lot from that. The camera works as inteded and the character moves correctly. Jumps can be tweaked and the animations doesn't work properly yet.

Platforms seem to work correctly with some easy patterns of movement, but need to implement and test more complex patterns.

I want to try an "Ice and Fire" system to learn more, where Fire can melt Ice and Ice can put out the fire.

Thank you for reading this far. I know this project isn't in a good state right now, I wanted to make it better before making it public. I will keep improving it as a learning process.
